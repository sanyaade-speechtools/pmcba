The site about the personal-moral-chat-bot-api.


The project originated out of the serious gaming course for the Creative Technology at the Universety of Twente.

The original idea was to create a social pet that would question the user about his or her social interactions to make the user reflect on their actions.
A combination of a Tamagotchi, the character Cmd. Data. from Star Trek and the ELIZA chat program. (A mood board which shows the idea of the project can be found here [moodBoard](http://dgoedie.moodshare.co/preview/13-05-2013_16-35/efb848fbbe3cba9c5f85d2c307e425ff/))

During the course of the project, however, we decided to change the goal of our project. Rather than programming the actual bot itself, we would create the tools necessary to incorporate the social context of the user into the Alice framework. The result is a graphical editor that allows basically anyone to create a conversation tree easily and efficiently. Secondly, we have developed a program that gets user data from Facebook and makes it available for use in the bot.
